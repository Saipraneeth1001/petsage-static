  <h1>About PetSage</h1>

  <p>
    PetSage was born from a deeply personal experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two years ago, my dog gradually lost her vision due to tick fever and
    inherited glaucoma. During that time, I visited multiple veterinary
    hospitals, consulted many doctors, and spent a significant amount of money —
    often just to ask small follow-up questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite all of this, I often felt uncertain, confused, and alone. I wished
    there was a way to get structured guidance, understand symptoms better, and
    recognize warning signs early — before rushing into expensive consultations.
  </p>

  <p>
    PetSage is built to address that gap.
  </p>

  <p>
    It helps pet parents:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe symptoms clearly</li>
    <li>Upload photos for visual context</li>
    <li>Track health history over time</li>
    <li>Understand when a situation may need urgent veterinary attention</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    PetSage is <strong>not a doctor</strong>. It does not diagnose, treat, or
    prescribe. Instead, it acts as a thoughtful filter — helping pet parents
    make informed decisions and approach veterinarians better prepared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is simple: reduce uncertainty, improve awareness, and help pets get
    timely care.
